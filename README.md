SMS Spam/Not Spam Detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to automatically classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). Leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 5,560 SMS messages, this project tackles the challenge of identifying unwanted or malicious content in text messages. The dataset is imbalanced, with 13% of the messages labeled as spam and 87% as ham, reflecting real-world scenarios where most messages are legitimate.
The core of this project is the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm that is particularly effective for text classification tasks. Naive Bayes is favored for its simplicity and speed, making it a popular choice for spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and other natural language processing tasks. Despite its assumption that features are independent—a condition rarely met in real-world data—Naive Bayes remains highly effective in many applications due to its robustness and ease of interpretation.
The project also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of the Naive Bayes algorithm, discussing Bayes' theorem and its application in calculating conditional probabilities. Various types of Naive Bayes classifiers, such as Bernoulli, Multinomial, and Gaussian, are explored, each suited to different types of data.
Performance is evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, which provide insights into the accuracy and reliability of the model, especially in the context of an imbalanced dataset. Precision helps in understanding how many of the messages classified as spam are actually spam, while Recall focuses on how many actual spam messages are correctly identified. The F1 Score, a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, offers a balanced measure of the model's performance.
This repository includes the dataset, Python code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts, making it a valuable resource for those interested in text classification and spam detection.
